## Features

- **TSV Processing**: Read and write stock data from TSV files
- **Data Analysis**: Calculate summaries and identify undervalued stocks
- **Web Dashboard**: Beautiful HTML/JS interface for viewing data
- **Date-based Organization**: Files organized by year/month/day
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd GRQ-validation
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
cargo run
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Process all TSV files in the docs directory:
```bash
cargo run -- --docs-path docs --recursive
```

Process a specific file:
```bash
cargo run -- --file docs/scores/2025/June/20.tsv
```

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
cargo run -- --verbose
```

### Command Line Options

- `--docs-path, -d`: Path to the docs directory (default: "docs")
- `--recursive, -r`: Process all TSV files recursively
- `--file, -f`: Process a specific TSV file
- `--verbose, -v`: Enable verbose logging

### Web Dashboard

The web dashboard is located at `docs/index.html` and will be served by GitHub Pages. It provides:

- Date-based navigation through stock data
- Summary statistics (total stocks, average score, undervalued count)
- Interactive table with sorting and filtering
- Visual indicators for stock performance

## TSV File Format

The application expects TSV files with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Stock | String | Stock symbol (e.g., "NYSE:AAPL") |
| Score | Float | Stock score (0.0 to 1.0) |
| Target | Float | Target price |
| ExDividendDate | Date | Ex-dividend date (optional) |
| DividendPerShare | Float | Dividend per share (optional) |
| Notes | String | Additional notes (optional) |
| intrinsicValuePerShareBasic | Float | Basic intrinsic value |
| intrinsicValuePerShareAdjusted | Float | Adjusted intrinsic value |

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Data Models**: Add new fields to `StockRecord` in `src/models.rs`
2. **Processing Logic**: Implement new analysis in `src/processor.rs`
3. **Web Interface**: Update the HTML/JS in `docs/index.html`

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cargo test
```

### Building for Production

Build an optimized release:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

#Prompt
The overall rust program should read the docs/index.json file to find which score files are present, then for each score file we should find the list of ticker codes ( first column). 

For each ticker code read the corresponding market data in the repo ../GRQ-shareprices2025Q1

For example market data for the ticker "NYSE:SEM" will be in the file data/S/SEM.json of the repo ../GRQ-shareprices2025Q1@SEM.json 

I want to create a short price history for each score file which contains only the tickers in that score file and up to 180 days worth of price history from that score file's date. ( We only started recording scores a few days ago so this price history file will be small at the moment) which will grow over time up to 180 days from the score file's date. 

I'm trying to validate the predictions in the score file ( which is the top 20 predictions), these predictions are for increase price over the next 90 days. As time goes on I will be able to tell how accurate these predictions are. 

I think we will be creating a corresponding "csv" which contains the market prices for each score file. 

I want to do the development feature by feature in a TDD manner so I can follow along and learn Rust. 

Let's start with the first test then implement.
