# GitHub Actions Deprecation Fixes

## Issue
The GitHub Actions workflows were using deprecated versions of actions, causing build failures with the error:
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `actions/upload-artifact` from v3 to v4
**Files Updated:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/rust.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

### 2. Updated `actions/cache` from v3 to v4
**Files Updated:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/rust.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
```

### 3. Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v5 to v7
**Files Updated:**
- `.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Create Pull Request
  uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Create Pull Request
  uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v7
```

### 4. Kept `actions/upload-pages-artifact` at v3
**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Reason:** This action is still at v3.0.1 as the latest version, so no update needed.

## Current Action Versions

### ✅ Up to Date Actions:
- `actions/checkout@v4` - Latest version
- `actions/configure-pages@v4` - Latest version
- `actions/deploy-pages@v4` - Latest version
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` - Updated from v3
- `actions/cache@v4` - Updated from v3
- `peter-evans/create-pull-request@v7` - Updated from v5

### ✅ Current Version Actions:
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` - Still current
- `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` - Still current

## Benefits of Updates

### 1. **Compatibility**
- Eliminates deprecation warnings and failures
- Ensures workflows continue to work with GitHub's latest infrastructure

### 2. **Performance**
- Newer versions often include performance improvements
- Better caching and artifact handling

### 3. **Security**
- Latest versions include security patches
- Reduced vulnerability exposure

### 4. **Features**
- Access to new features and improvements
- Better error handling and debugging

## Verification

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Push the changes** to trigger the workflows
2. **Check the Actions tab** for successful runs
3. **Monitor for any deprecation warnings**

## Future Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Monitor GitHub's deprecation notices
- Update actions when new versions are released
- Test workflows after updates

### Automated Updates
