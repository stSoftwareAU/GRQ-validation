# CORS Proxy Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The chart for April 22nd (and potentially other dates) was not appearing due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) proxy failures when trying to fetch market index data (SP500 and NASDAQ) from Yahoo Finance.

## Error Messages

The console showed these errors:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=...' from origin 'https://stsoftwareau.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy
GET https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=... net::ERR_FAILED 500 (Internal Server Error)
GET https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/... 403 (Forbidden)
```

## Root Cause

The CORS proxies used to fetch market data from Yahoo Finance were failing:
1. **Primary proxy** (`api.allorigins.win`) - Returned 500 Internal Server Error
2. **Secondary proxy** (`cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com`) - Returned 403 Forbidden

This prevented the market comparison data from loading, which could interfere with chart display.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Multiple Proxy Fallbacks**
Added three CORS proxy options instead of two:
```javascript
const sp500Proxies = [
    `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=${encodeURIComponent(url)}`,
    `https://corsproxy.io/?${encodeURIComponent(url)}`,
    `https://thingproxy.freeboard.io/fetch/${encodeURIComponent(url)}`
];
```

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- Reduced timeout from 10 seconds to 8 seconds
- Added more specific error detection for rate limits
- Improved logging to show which proxy is being attempted
- Graceful fallback when all proxies fail

### 3. **User-Friendly Messages**
When market data fails to load, users now see:
```
Market Comparison Unavailable: SP500 and NASDAQ data cannot be loaded due to CORS restrictions. 
The chart will still display portfolio performance data.
```

### 4. **Optional Market Data Loading**
Added a localStorage option to skip market data loading entirely:
```javascript
// To disable market data loading (for debugging)
localStorage.setItem('skipMarketData', 'true');

// To re-enable market data loading
localStorage.removeItem('skipMarketData');
```

## Chart Display Fix

The chart will now display properly even when market data fails because:

1. **Portfolio data is independent** of market index data
2. **Error handling prevents crashes** when market data fails
3. **User notifications** explain what's happening
4. **Graceful degradation** - chart shows portfolio performance without market comparison
5. **Fallback chart creation** - when no market data is available, a basic chart showing portfolio targets is displayed
6. **Multiple proxy fallbacks** - three different CORS proxies are tried before giving up
7. **Optional market data loading** - users can disable market data loading entirely for debugging

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Load the April 22nd chart
4. Look for messages like:
   - "Attempting SP500 fetch with proxy 1/3..."
   - "SP500 fetch failed with proxy 1: [error]"
   - "Market comparison data unavailable - CORS proxies may be down"

### Method 2: Disable Market Data
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Run: `localStorage.setItem('skipMarketData', 'true')`
4. Refresh the page
5. Chart should load immediately without attempting market data

### Method 3: Re-enable Market Data
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Run: `localStorage.removeItem('skipMarketData')`
4. Refresh the page
5. Market data loading will be attempted again

## Expected Behavior

### When CORS Proxies Work:
- Chart displays with portfolio performance
- Market comparison section shows SP500 and NASDAQ data
- No error messages in console

### When CORS Proxies Fail:
- Chart displays with portfolio performance
- Market comparison section shows warning message
- Console shows proxy failure messages
- Application continues to function normally

### When Market Data Fails Completely:
- Fallback chart displays showing portfolio targets
- Basic stock table shows score data only
- Warning message explains limited functionality
- Application remains functional for basic analysis

## Future Improvements

### 1. **Local Market Data**
Consider storing market data locally to avoid CORS issues:
- Download SP500/NASDAQ data periodically
- Store in JSON files alongside score data
- Load from local files instead of Yahoo Finance API

### 2. **Alternative Data Sources**
Explore other market data providers:
- Alpha Vantage API
- IEX Cloud API
- Financial Modeling Prep API

### 3. **Server-Side Proxy**
Create a server-side proxy to handle CORS:
- Simple Node.js/Express server
- Proxy requests to Yahoo Finance
- Handle CORS headers properly

## Files Modified

### **docs/app.js**
- Updated `loadMarketIndexData()` method
- Added multiple proxy fallbacks
- Improved error handling
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Added optional market data skipping

## Impact

- ✅ **Chart displays properly** even when market data fails
- ✅ **Better user experience** with clear error messages
- ✅ **More reliable** with multiple proxy options
- ✅ **Debugging options** available for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** maintains core functionality

The April 22nd chart should now display correctly, showing portfolio performance data even when market comparison data is unavailable.
