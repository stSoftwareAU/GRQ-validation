# GRQ Stock Prediction Validation Dashboard

This GitHub Pages application validates AI stock predictions by comparing actual performance against:

1. **90-day target gains** (from the score files)
2. **10% annual cost of capital** (â‰ˆ2.5% per 90 days)

## Features

### ðŸ“Š **Performance Tracking**
- **Target Performance**: Shows the expected 90-day gains for each stock
- **Actual Performance**: Tracks real market performance since prediction date
- **Cost of Capital**: Compares against 10% annual return benchmark
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows how much of the 90-day target has been achieved

### ðŸ“ˆ **Interactive Charts**
- **Time-series visualization** of performance over time
- **Three key metrics**:
  - Green line: Target performance (linear progression)
  - Red line: Cost of capital (compound growth)
  - Blue line: Actual performance (real data)

### ðŸ“‹ **Individual Stock Analysis**
- **Stock-by-stock breakdown** with current prices and gains
- **Progress indicators** showing percentage of target achieved
- **Color-coded performance** (green = positive, red = negative)

## Data Sources

### Score Files (TSV)
- **Location**: `scores/YYYY/Month/DD.tsv`
- **Format**: Stock predictions with target prices and scores
- **Content**: Top 20 stock picks with 90-day targets

### Market Data (CSV)
- **Location**: `scores/YYYY/Month/DD.csv`
- **Format**: Daily market prices (date, ticker, high, low, open, close)
- **Generated by**: Rust program (`run.sh`)

## Usage

1. **Select Score File**: Choose from available prediction dates
2. **Adjust Cost of Capital**: Modify the annual rate (default: 10%)
3. **View Performance**: See real-time comparison against targets
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor how predictions are performing over time

## Data Updates

The dashboard automatically updates when:
- New score files are added to the index
- Market data CSV files are generated by the Rust program
- You run `./run.sh` to process all score files

## Missing Data Handling

- **No market data**: Shows "No data available yet" message
- **Partial data**: Displays available data with clear indicators
- **Future dates**: Gracefully handles predictions that haven't matured yet

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Chart.js
- **Data Format**: TSV for scores, CSV for market data
- **Real-time**: No server required, runs entirely in browser
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Development

To run locally:
```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

The application reads from the same data files that your Rust program generates, making it perfect for validating AI predictions in real-time.
